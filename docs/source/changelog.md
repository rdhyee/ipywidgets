7.0
---

Major user-visible changes in ipywidgets 7.0 include:

- The `Label` widget has no width restriction: ([#1269](https://github.com/jupyter-widgets/ipywidgets/pull/1269))
- Using function annotations to specify interact controls for a function is now deprecated and will be removed in a future version of ipywidgets. ([#1292](https://github.com/jupyter-widgets/ipywidgets/pull/1292))
- Widgets are now displayed in the output area in the classic notebook and are treated as any other output. This allows the widgets to work more naturally with other cell output. To delete a widget, clear the output from the cell. Output from functions triggered by a widget view is appended to the output area that contains the widget view. This means that printed text will be appended to the output, and calling `clear_output()` will delete the entire output, including the widget view. ([#1274](https://github.com/jupyter-widgets/ipywidgets/pull/1274), [#1353](https://github.com/jupyter-widgets/ipywidgets/pull/1353))
- The Select widget now is a listbox instead of a dropdown, reverting back to the pre-6.0 behavior. ([#1238](https://github.com/jupyter-widgets/ipywidgets/pull/1238))
- The Select and SelectMultiple widgets now have a `rows` attribute for the number of rows to display, consistent with the Textarea widget. The `layout.height` attribute overrides this to control the height of the widget. ([#1250](https://github.com/jupyter-widgets/ipywidgets/pull/1250))
- Selection widgets (`Select`, `Dropdown`, etc.) now coerce their `options` argument to a tuple of `(label, value)` pairs. This makes it clearer the order in which the options will be presented. New `.value`, `.label`, and `.index` traits make it easier to observe or access the selected option.  ([#1262](https://github.com/jupyter-widgets/ipywidgets/pull/1262))
- The `layout` and `style` traits can be set with a dictionary for convenience, which will automatically converted to a Layout or Style object. ([#1253](https://github.com/jupyter-widgets/ipywidgets/pull/1253))
  ```python
  IntSlider(layout={'width': '100%'}, style={'handle_color': 'lightgreen'})
  ```
- Removed the version validation check since it was causing too many false warnings about the widget javascript not being installed or the wrong version number. It is now up to the user to ensure that the ipywidgets and widgetsnbextension packages are compatible. ([#1219](https://github.com/jupyter-widgets/ipywidgets/pull/1219))
- Play range is now inclusive (max value is max, instead of max-1), to be consistent with Sliders
- A refactoring of the text, slider, slider range, and progress widgets in resulted in the `BoundedIntText` and `BoundedFloatText` losing their `step` attribute (which was previously ignored), and a number of these widgets changing their `_model_name` and/or `_view_name` attributes ([#1290](https://github.com/jupyter-widgets/ipywidgets/pull/1290))
- The `Checkbox` description is now on the right of the checkbox and is clickable. The `Checkbox` widget has a new `indent` attribute (defaults to `True`) to line up nicely with controls that have descriptions. To make the checkbox align to the left, set `indent` to `False`. ([#1346](https://github.com/jupyter-widgets/ipywidgets/pull/1346))
- The `Play` widget now has an optional repeat toggle button (visible by default). ([#1190](https://github.com/jupyter-widgets/ipywidgets/pull/1190))
- A new Password widget, which behaves exactly like the Text widget, but hides the typed text: `Password()`. ([#1310](https://github.com/jupyter-widgets/ipywidgets/pull/1310))
- A new SelectionRangeSlider widget for selecting ranges from ordered lists of objects. For example, this enables having a slider to select a date range. ([#1356](https://github.com/jupyter-widgets/ipywidgets/pull/1356))
- The documentation theme is changed to the new standard Jupyter theme. ([#1363](https://github.com/jupyter-widgets/ipywidgets/pull/1363))

Major changes developers should be aware of include:

- The python `@register` decorator for widget classes no longer takes a string argument, but registers a widget class using the `_model_*` and `_view_*` traits in the class. Using the decorator as `@register('name')` is deprecated and should be changed to just `@register`. [#1228](https://github.com/jupyter-widgets/ipywidgets/pull/1228), [#1276](https://github.com/jupyter-widgets/ipywidgets/pull/1276)
- Widgets will now need correct `_model_module` and `_view_module` Unicode traits defined.
- Selection widgets now sync the index of the selected item, rather than the label. ([#1262](https://github.com/jupyter-widgets/ipywidgets/pull/1262))
- The widget protocol was significantly overhauled. The new widget messaging protocol (version 2) is specified in the [version 2 protocol documentation](https://github.com/jupyter-widgets/ipywidgets/blob/master/jupyter-widgets-schema/messages.md).
- Custom serializers in Javascript are now synchronous, and should return a snapshot of the widget state. The default serializer makes a copy of JSONable objects. ([#1270](https://github.com/jupyter-widgets/ipywidgets/pull/1270))
- Custom serializers in either Python or Javascript can now return a structure which contains binary buffers. If a binary buffer is in the serialized data structure, the message will be synced in binary, which is much more efficient. ([#1194](https://github.com/jupyter-widgets/ipywidgets/pull/1194))
- A custom serializer is given the widget instance as its second argument, and a custom deserializer is given the widget manager as its second argument.
- The widget manager `clear_state` method no longer has a `commlessOnly` argument. All models in the widget manager will be closed and cleared when `clear_state` is called. ([#1354](https://github.com/jupyter-widgets/ipywidgets/pull/1354))
- The python `ipywidget.domwidget.LabeledWidget` is now `ipywidget.widget_description.DescriptionWidget`, and there is a new `ipywidget.widget_description.DescriptionStyle` that lets the user set the CSS width of the description.

6.0
---

Major user-visible changes in ipywidgets 6.0 include:

 - Rendering of Jupyter interactive widgets in various web contexts

     sphinx documentation: http://ipywidgets.readthedocs.io/en/latest/examples/Widget%20List.html
     nbviewer: http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/jupyter-widgets/ipywidgets/blob/master/docs/source/examples/Widget%20List.ipynb
     Static web pages: http://jupyter.org/widgets

 -  Addition of a DatePicker widget in the core widget collection.

 - Changes to the automatic control generation syntax in @interact, inspired by the Sage interact syntax.

 - Removal of APIs which had been deprecated in 5.0, including top-level styling in attributes of DOMWidgets and some corner cases in the behavior of `@interact`.

 - A new API for custom styling of widgets is provided, through a top-level `style` attribute. For example, the color of a slider handler can be set by `slider.style.handle_color`.

- Removal of the Proxy and PlaceProxy widgets.

- Removal of the deprecated `FlexBox` widget. Use the `Box`, `HBox`, or `VBox` widgets instead. Various flex properties can be set using the `layout` attribute.

- Removal of the deprecated `Latex` widget. Use the new `HTMLMath` widget with Latex math inside `$` or `$$` delimiters instead.

- Removal of the deprecated layout properties on a widget such as `.width`, `.height`, etc. Use the `layout` attribute with a `Layout` widget to manage various layout properties instead.

- The `Label` widget now has styling to make it consistent with labels on various widgets. To have freeform text with mathematics, use the new `HTMLMath` widget.

- Removal of the `button_style` attribute of the Dropdown widget

 - Addition of an OutputWidget for capturing output and rich display objects. @interact has changed to use an OutputWidget for function output instead of overwriting the output area of a cell.

 - The jupyter-js-widgets Javascript implementation now relies on the PhosphorJS framework for the management of rich layout and a better integration of JupyterLab.

- Numerous bug fixes.

*Note for custom widget authors:*

ipywidgets 6.0 breaks backward compatibility with respect to the handling of default values of the JavaScript side. Now, the default values for core widget models are specified with a `default()` method returning a dictionary instead of a `default` dictionary attribute. If you want your library to be backwards compatible with ipywidgets 5.x, you could use  [_.result](http://underscorejs.org/#result) like this:
```javascript
...
defaults: function() {
        return _.extend(_.result(this, 'widgets.DOMWidgetModel.prototype.defaults'), {
          ....
        })
},
...
```


This should not have an impact when using your custom widgets in the classic notebook, but will be really important when deploying your interactive widgets in web contexts.
